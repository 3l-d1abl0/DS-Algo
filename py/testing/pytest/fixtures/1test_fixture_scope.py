'''DEMO/Test fixtures have four diï¬€erent scopes:
- By default the scope is set to function and this specifies that the fixture should be called for all tests in the module.

- Class scope specifies the test fixture should be executed once per test class.
- Module scope specifies that the fixture should be executed once per module.
- Session scope specifies that the fixture should be executed once when PyTest starts.
